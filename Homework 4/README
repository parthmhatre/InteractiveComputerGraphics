README
> This program should be tested on Linux(Tux)
> Download and unzip file pdm73_a4.zip
> To run your program go into the directory where you will find the assignment where you have unzipped the folder i.e pdm73_a4.zip in tux
> The make command will generate an execuatable file assign_4
> Run the executable file that displays the 2 windows result i.e. assign_4
> You can right click on the screen to get a menu which has 3 options (Scale, Translate, Rotate). The default choice is Scale. Choose one of the choices.
> Scaling: Pressing 'a' will scale (increasingly) with respect to the x axis while 'z' will scale (decreasingly) with respect to the x axis. pressing 's' will scale (increasingly) with respect to the y axis while 'x' will scale (decreasingly) with respect to the y axis. Pressing 'd' will scale (increasingly) with respect to the z axis while 'c' will scale (decreasingly) with respect to the x axis.
>Translating: Pressing 'a' will translate (positively) with respect to the x axis while 'z' will translate (negatively) with respect to the x axis. Pressing 's' will translate (positively) with respect to the y axis while 'x' will translate (negatively) with respect to the y axis. Pressing 'd' will translate (positively) with respect to the z axis while 'c' will translate (negatively) with respect to the z axis.
>Rotating: Pressing 'a' will rotate (clockwise) with respect to the x axis while 'z' will rotate (anticlockwise) with respect to the x axis. Pressing 's' will rotate (clockwise) with respect to the y axis while 'x' will rotate (anticlockwise) with respect to the y axis. Pressing 'd' will rotate (clockwise) with respect to the z axis while 'c' will rotate (anticlockwise) with respect to the z axis.
>You can use 'w' and 'e' to increase and decrease the Scaling, Translating and Rotating factors respectively.
>'r' is used to reset the cube to the original position.
> We can quit the program by just pressing 'q'
